\chapter{Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

The following are some examples of programs that we would like to be written in \lepix{}. This does not reflect final syntax and is mostly based on equivalent or near-equivalent C-style code:

\input{code/red.lpx}

The red example shows up some simple conditionals in a for loop to write all-red to an image. It is not the most exciting code, but it has a lot of moving parts and will help us test several parts of the library, from how to call functions to basic iteration techniques.

\input{code/flip.lpx}

This above code is a bit more complicated. It shows that we can save a slice of a matrix's (image's) row, operate on it, and even call the library function \lstinline|lib.swap| on its \lstinline|pixel| elements. It also demonstrates a string literal, and passing it to the \lstinline|lib.read| function to pull out a regular image from a PNG, and then saving that same image. It also shows off an implicit return 0 (we expect our programs to be run in the context of a shell environment, and to play nice with the existing C tools in that manner).
