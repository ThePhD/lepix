\section{switch}
% The switch block
% switch (var x = some_other_variable; x) {
%	case consant-value:
%		...
%	end;
% }
% we switch on the value of the final var, 'x'
% scope for the variable "x" lasts until the closing bracket "}"

\begin{enumerate}
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
switch (variable) {
	case (constant expression): 
		statements
	end;
	case (constant expression): 
		statements
	end;
	case (constant expression): 
		statements
	end;
	default: statements
}
\end{lstlisting}
	\item \lstinline|switch| statements can be used as an alternative to a nested \lstinline|if| statements.
	\item The variable is compared against the constant expression for each case, and if it is equal to this expression then the statements in that case are executed.
	\item If the variable does not match any of the cases then the default case is executed.
	\item The statements in each case must be followed by an \lstinline|end| statement.
\end{enumerate}




As with if statements, if a variable is declared within the switch like \lstinline|switch (var x = other_variable; x) {...}|, the scope for variable \texttt{x} is within that particular switch block.
