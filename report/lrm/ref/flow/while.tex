\section{while}
\label{sec:while}
% The while block
% while (var x = 20; x < 30) {}
% the above is valid: as long as the final expression in a semi-colon delimited list evaluates to a boolean the while block is valid
% scope for the variable "x" lasts until the closing bracket "}"

\begin{enumerate}
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
while (expression; expression; ... ; condition)  {
	statements 
}
\end{lstlisting}
	\item \lstinline|while| loops are used to repeat a block of code until some condition is met.
	\item Every time a loop condition evaluates to true, the \lstinline|while| loop's block and statements are executed.
	\item When the condition evaluates to false, the \lstinline|while| loop's execution is stopped.
	\item Expressions before condition are evaluated only once. For example: \lstinline|while (var x = 20; x < 30) {...}| is a valid the \lstinline|while| loop, and only the final \lstinline|x < 30| is evaluated on each loop execution.
	\item Loops are dangerous because they can potentially run forever. Make sure your conditions are done properly, or use Flow Control keywords and primitives discussed in \ref{sec:breaks}:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
while (var x = 1; x <= 10) {
	arr[x] = 1;
	x = x + 1;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
