\section{Threads}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The code inside of a parallel block can be dispatched to multiple executing threads.
	\item Each thread that is spawned in this way will have its own scope, which is created when the thread is spawned and destroyed when the thread is killed.
	\item Each thread has its own copy of each variable that is declared within the scope of the loop statements.
	\item All variables are shared by default, except the ones declared in the parallel scope.
\end{enumerate}
