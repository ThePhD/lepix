\section{Parallel Execution Model}
% The way parallel execution is modeled in the language
% that is, recognizing that a program may have multiple parts of itself being run at the same time and that it is beneficial to have a primitive that encapsulates that
% parallel execution is simply the running of separate functions at the same time, separated by primitives called 'threads'

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Parallel Execution is when two computations defined by the language are run at the exact same time by the abstract virtual machine, capable of accessing the same memory space.
	\item The primary parallel primitive is a parallel-marked block.
	\item Use of parallel primitives does not guarantee parallel execution: computation specified to run in parallel may run sequentially.\footnote{This could be due to hardware limitations, operating system limitations, and other factors of the machine.}
\end{enumerate}
