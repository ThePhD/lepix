\section{Variables and Declarations}
% another small program showing declaration of variables and doing some arithmetic
% mention data types for the first time
% code example with array (c guide added if here)

\subsection{Variables}

Variables are made with the \lstinline|var| declaration. You can declare and assign variables by giving them a name and then referencing that name in other places.

\subsection{Mutability}
% let is a immutable, var is mutable

Variables can also be declared immutable or unchanging by declaring them with \lstinline|let|. That is, \lstinline|let| is the same as a \lstinline|var const|, and \lstinline|var| is the same as \lstinline|let mutable|.
