\chapter{Language Reference Manual}

On the next page is the language reference manual for the original \lepix{} language. The final implementation did not meet all of the requirements due to having to work alone for the last two weeks and insufficient teammate contribution during the project, but thankfully we still capture the majority of the language's constructs in every thing but the final code generation and semantic analysis stages, leaving room to improve the implementation in the future.
