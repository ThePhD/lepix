\section{Character Sets}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The basic source character set consists of the ASCII letters and symbols.
	\item The basic source character set will be used throughout this document to define the language and is the normative set of characters and control characters for this language.
	\item The universal character name scheme provides a way to specify names outside of the basic source character set.
	\item An implementation may provide support for a superset of the basic source character set or a compatible source character set, providing the following: every character in the basic source character set has a distinct and unambiguous mapping to a character in the implementation-defined source character set.
\end{enumerate}
