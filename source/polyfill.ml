(* In Javascript, there's a concept called 'Polyfill'. It's the concept that
stuff that's missing can be filled over by libraries implemented by regular people
because the committee that oversees Javascript can't just decide to
make certain implementations and other things standard.

This is that thing, for OCrapml. *)
